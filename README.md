# IDE Tips & Tricks (and other shortcuts to make you a more efficient programmer)

## NOTE: This workshop has been reimagined and will not be delivered as in this same format in 2024. Instead, we're planning a "Keyboard shortcut(s) of the week". Learn more about [why we're changing the way we deliver this content](https://github.com/UCSB-MEDS/IDE-tips-and-tricks/wiki/Updated-Approach-for-Delivering-IDE-Tips-&-Tricks---Keyboard-Shortcuts#what-is-this), the [shortcut schedule](https://github.com/UCSB-MEDS/IDE-tips-and-tricks/wiki/Updated-Approach-for-Delivering-IDE-Tips-&-Tricks---Keyboard-Shortcuts#proposed-summer-schedule-of-shortcuts), and the [Google Calendar "event" language for sharing shortcuts with students](https://github.com/UCSB-MEDS/IDE-tips-and-tricks/wiki/Updated-Approach-for-Delivering-IDE-Tips-&-Tricks---Keyboard-Shortcuts#calendar-events).

**Taught by:** [@samanthacsik](https://github.com/samanthacsik)  
**Duration:** 2 hours

As environmental data scientists, we spend *a lot* of time writing code in different IDEs (**I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironments), like RStudio, VSCode, and Jupyter Notebooks via Anaconda Navigator. Taking some time to learn keyboard shortcuts (and customization tips) can make you a more efficient (and happier) hacker!
